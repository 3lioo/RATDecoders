{"name":"RAT Decoders","tagline":"Python Decoders for Common Remote Access Trojans","body":"###Welcome\r\n\r\nThis Repo will hold a collection of Python Scripts that will extract,decode and display the configuration settings from common rats.\r\n\r\nEach of these decoders is running on http://malwareconfig.com and has additional features that are not included in the scripts.\r\n\r\nIf you wish to contribute please feel free to fork or email me on decoders@malwareconfig.com\r\n\r\nYou can read more about the project on my blog at http://techanarchy.net/2014/04/rat-decoders/\r\n\r\n###Current Rats\r\nThese are the currently supported RATS:\r\n\r\n- Adwind\r\n- Adzok\r\n- Albertino Advanced RAT\r\n- AlienSpy\r\n- Arcom\r\n- BlackNix\r\n- BlackShades\r\n- Blue Banana\r\n- Bozok\r\n- ClientMesh\r\n- Crimson\r\n- CyberGate\r\n- DarkComet\r\n- drakddoser\r\n- DarkRat\r\n- Gh0st\r\n- Graeme\r\n- Java Droppers\r\n- jRat\r\n- LostDoor\r\n- LuxNet\r\n- NanoCore\r\n- njRat\r\n- Pandora\r\n- PoisionIvy\r\n- Punisher\r\n- ShadowTech\r\n- SpyGate\r\n- SmallNet\r\n- Tapaoux\r\n- Unrecom\r\n- Vantom\r\n- Vertex\r\n- VirusRat\r\n- xtreme\r\n\r\n###Upcoming RATS\r\n\r\n- NetWire\r\n- Plasma\r\n- Any Other Rats i can find.\r\n\r\n###Installation\r\n\r\nAll the decoders are written in Python 2.7 each decoder can run independently and each has their own requirements. \r\nFor all existing decoders the only external modules required are:\r\n- pefile\r\n- pycrypto\r\n- pype32\r\n\r\nPyCrypto for windows can be found on voidspace all others can be installed with pip or via git. \r\n\r\n###Usage\r\n\r\n- Each Script comes with its own -h option use it :)\r\nTypical Usage is \r\n\r\n```\r\nroot@Viper:~/RATDecoders# python DarkComet.py\r\nUsage: DarkComet.py inFile outConfig\r\nDarkComet Rat Config Extractor\r\n\r\nOptions:\r\n  --version   show program's version number and exit\r\n  -h, --help  show this help message and exit\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nSome of the decoders have a recursive mode used with a ```-r``` and a dir name\r\n\r\n###Projects\r\n\r\nThere are a couple of projects that make use of these decoders. If you wish to integrate these in to your own let me know and i will help where i can. If you use it and i missed you also let me know. \r\n\r\nViper - https://github.com/botherder/viper\r\n\r\nDC3-MWCP - https://github.com/Defense-Cyber-Crime-Center/DC3-MWCP\r\n\r\n### ToDo\r\n\r\n- There will be more decoders coming\r\n- Finish the Recursive mode on several of the Decoders\r\n\r\n### Thanks\r\n\r\nFull credit where credit is due. \r\n\r\nMalware.lu for the initial xtreme Rat Writeup - https://code.google.com/p/malware-lu/wiki/en_xtreme_RAT\r\n\r\nFireye for their Poison Ivy and Xtreme rat WriteUps (Even though they ignored my tweet and reply ) - http://www.fireeye.com/blog/technical/2014/02/xtremerat-nuisance-or-threat.html\r\n\r\nShawn Denbow and Jesse Herts for their paper here - http://www.matasano.com/research/PEST-CONTROL.pdf Saved me a lot of time \r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
